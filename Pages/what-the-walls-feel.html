<p class="article-top">
    <sc>A few months ago</sc>, I was contacted by <a href="http://frankhorvat.com/">Frank Horvat</a>, a composer and pianist from Toronto. He was about to launch a new &nbsn;album,<snl label="around">The album is titled <i8>What Goes Around</i8> and you can <a href="http://frankhorvat.com/discography/what-goes-around/">you can stream the whole thing for free</a>. Do check it out, it is wonderful music.</snl> and wanted me to make a music video for one of the tracks. The track is titled <i>What the Walls Feel as they Stare at Rob Ford Sitting in His &nbsn;Office,</i><snr label="programme-notes">You can read brief <a href="http://frankhorvat.com/composition/what-walls-feel-as-they-stare-at-rob-ford-sitting-in-his-office/">programme notes</a> about the reasoning behind this most unusual title.</snr> and it features six different clarinet parts, all of which are played by <a href="https://www.peterstoll.ca/">Peter Stoll</a>, a clarinetist from Toronto.
</p>
<p>
    Frank's new album is very much is the style of musical minimalism&mdash;think Steve Reich, Ann Southam, Julius Eastman, Henryk G&#243;recki, etc. And consequently, the task of creating a visual accompaniment to his music was a very interesting challenge, for two main reasons:
</p>
<ul class="dash">
    <li>
        The sheer lenght of the piece. It's 9 minutes and 2 seconds long, by far the longest abstract film that I ever worked on. Since repetition is one of minimalism's core techniques, it tends to work best when it is considerably stretched over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        The very smooth dynamics and homogeneity of the piece. Minimalism also tends to revel in tiny changes, in subtle variations of repeated material, and as such it typically doesn't feature a lot of dynamics (contrasts between quiet and loud parts). So not only would I have to make a <i>long</i> film, but I also couldn’t rely on big dramatic changes to sustain interest. Big visual changes, for example accelerating the movement or completely changing the colour palette, would be at odds with the music, where a droning, self-similar feel is maintained throughout.
    </li>
</ul>
<!-- <pn>
    One of the challenges that I forsaw with this project was the sheer lenght of the musical piece&mdash;it's 9 minutes and 2 seconds long, by far the longest abstract film that I ever worked on. And also, over the course of whole piece, there is a very strong homogeneity in the musical material. The colour, tonality and timbre of the whole piece remains very homogenous throught its duration. There is a subtle build up of the emotion of the piece as it goes, but the build up is subtle. So I knew that I coudn't rely on dramatic changes in the visuals to sustain interest. I knew that following this minimalist piece of music would require similar minimalist means in the image: intricate variations on similar elements.

<!-- <p>
    So I knew that I had to produce a <i>lot</i> of material, and that this material needed to resemble itself&mdash;with &nbsn;variations.<snr label="reich">But on another level, of course, I knew that algorithmic animation was the perfect tool for the job&mdash;the cover album for the original 1978 recording of Steve Reich's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_for_18_Musicians"><i8>Music for 18 Musicians</i8></a> demonstrates well how intricate and geometric patterns are a great way to visualize minimalist music.</snr>

<h3>Searching for ideas</h3>

<pn>
    <sc>It's my second time</sc> doing commission animation work using algorithmic art. The first time was for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFufr93KNoQ">music video</a> directed by <a href="https://pascalinelefebvre.tumblr.com/">Pascaline Lefebvre</a>, an illustrator, author, and filmmaker from Montréal. Most of the animation in the video was made by Pascaline, but she hired me to animate the flocks of birds that you can see during a few moments in the &nbsn;video.<snl label="flocks">The flocking algorithms that I used for this video were inspired by Daniel Shiffman's videos on the subject. All the code written for this project <a href="https://github.com/pelletierauger/Oiseaux">can be found on GitHub</a>. The work done for each scene of the video is on its own Git branch.</snl>

<!--     I got this idea that the main process that creates the movements in the film should be simple mathematical formulas. I generally find that simple mathematical formulas are a great way to generate a large amount of variations&mdash;something that I find perhaps more challenging when a very complicated algorithm is in charge of the animation (but of the course the boundaries between any &ldquo;domains&rdquo; of algorithmic animation are very blurry, as a complicated algorithm can evidently include some simple mathematical formulas which can then be modified at will to create endless variations). -->

<p>
    So I'm not accustomed to searching for algorithmic ideas that have a clear purpose. But I absolutely love to search for ideas so I tried a lot of different things, listening to Frank's music a lot while sketching an assortment of ideas. I eventually had an idea that I found very interesting: a wall of small dots moving in different choreographies, forming into a series of intricate patterns. I sketched out a prototype using the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/"><lnum>p5</lnum>.js web editor</a>. Here it &nbsn;is:<snr label="prototype">You can also see <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/guillaume/sketches/ej_9eAWxI">this sketch and its code</a> in the <lnum>p5</lnum>.js web editor.</snr>
</p>

<div id="dot-grid-demo"></div>

<pn>
    The wall was a good visual anchor for the whole thing considering the title of the musical piece. Even if the dots are moving in smooth oscillations, it's very clear that they are ultimately laid out in a strict grid. I enjoy the tension between those two phenomena, and thought it was a good visual metaphor for the music. The walls are ruminating, contorting themselves into worried thoughts.
</pn>

<h3>The system</h3>
<!--  for <i>What the Walls Feel&hellip;</i> -->
<pn>
    <sc>I will now try</sc> to explain how the system behind the music video works. It all starts with a two-dimensional grid of dots, with an <im>x</im> horizontal axis and a <im>y</im> vertical axis. Each dot occupies one spot within the grid. For example, the dot at the top left has a position of <im>x = 0, y = 0</im>.
</pn>

<img class="inline-image" src="../../../images/what-the-walls-feel/grid.png">

<pn>
    Each dot in this grid is able to move in space. Its initial position in space is defined by the <im>x</im> and <im>y</im> values of the cell in which it is contained. But then, the dot's final position <im>d</im> is calculated by the mathematical equation below.
</pn>

<math>
\begin{align*}
    m   &= x \cdot y \cdot 0.001 + t\\
    d_x &= x + \cos(m)\\
    d_y &= y + \sin(m)
\end{align*}
</math>

<!-- read-more -->
<pn>
    An identical copy of this equation is sent to all the dots, but the result that it gives for each dot is different, because all dots have different <im>x</im> and <im>y</im> values. So this equation has three inputs: <im>x</im>, <im>y</im>, and <im>t</im>. The <im>x</im> and <im>y</im> values are the position of the dot in the two-dimensional grid. The third value, <im>t</im>, is the <i>moment in time</i>. It is a value that starts at <im>0</im> when the animation begins and it is simply incremented on each frame of animation. In this case, it is incremented by <im>\pi / 60</im>, an arbitrary number that I chose after trying different numbers and figuring how at which speed the animation was the most interesting to &nbsn;watch.<snl label="arbitrary">I find it interesting to point out the amount of arbitrary decisions that are taken in the design of such systems, because I remember when I was starting out a few years ago, looking at other people's code, I was often under the impression that all parameters of any given system were chosen for some mystical reasons that were out of my grasp, while really, most of this is trying out a ton of different values and slowly approaching what <i8>looks the nicest to you</i8>. In this case, <im>\pi / 60</im> also means that this function will start repeating itself every <im>120</im> frames, since the sine and cosine functions repeat themselves over <im>2\pi</im>.</snl> The <im>t</im> value is identical for each dot&mdash;time goes forward at the same speed for all dots.
</pn>
<p>
    So once this formula is calculated for each dot, the <im>d_x</im> and <im>d_y</im> values of each dot will determine its exact position in space. Note that any dot can fly <i>outside</i> of its origin cell&mdash;the cell's purpose is to give its dot an initial position, not to constrain the dots&rsquo; movements within bounds.
</p>

<h3>Endless variations</h3>

<pn>
    <sc>What I enjoyed</sc> about this system when I started to play with it is the implied infinity of variations that it can produce. By changing any parameters from the formula, but more importantly by writing entirely different formulas, I could get an infinite amount of different choreographies of dots.
</pn>
<p>
    For example, the equation below gave me a very big surprise. The resulting animation doesn't look like a pattern of oscillation anymore. It looks like it was generated by a complicated algorithm that moves data around.
</p>


<!-- let xx = x + pow(cos(y * 0.5 + t * 0.025), 700) * y * x * 200.5; -->
<!-- let yy = y + pow(sin(x * 0.5 + t * 0.025), 700) * y * x * 200.5; -->

<math>
\begin{align*}
    m   &= x \cdot y \cdot 200.5\\
    d_x &= x + m \cdot \cos\bigg(\frac{y}{2} + \frac{t}{40}\bigg)^{700}\\
    d_y &= y + m \cdot \sin\bigg(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{t}{40}\bigg)^{700}
\end{align*}
</math>
