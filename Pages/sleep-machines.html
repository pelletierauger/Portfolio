    I cannot sleep anymore. I lie in my bed and feel my body shaking from the inside like an electrical current is passing through me. It has been years since my last good night of sleep. Years. Years about which my memories are vague, painful, and regretful. Ever so regretful. Over the years I have felt my intellectual faculties fading away, or rather being fractured into tiny unrecognizable pieces. I have felt that I was losing the tools that would allow me to climb from the hole I was falling into. I now live on Rue Everett in Montreal, and am awake through a winter night that lasts for months.

    I spend the bulk of my time browsing mindlessly on the internet. I never have any memory of what I saw or read the day before. Inattention engulfs me. In a way I am still frantically trying to get out of my hole and accomplish something; I just have no tools to navigate anywhere.

    In the dark night of Everett, the memory-conservation machines of my mind are failing. They\'re buzzing around like franctic bees but they\'re incapable of doing anything. Elles vrombissent. Sleep machines. Les machines du sommeil.
