<p class="article-top">
    <sc>In the summer of 2017</sc>, I read two wonderful books by Seymour Papert that profoundly changed my way of thinking about learning and education: <i>Mindstorms</i> and <i>The Children's</i> &nbsn;<i>Machine</i>.<snl label="bookclub">I read <span class="italic8">Mindstorms</span> as part of the <lnum>p5</lnum>.diversity interactive book club. It was an amazing experience.</snl> Papert was a passionate educator, mathematician, and computer scientist who believed that computers could and should change the way we learn. One of his most interesting inventions is <i>Turtle geometry</i>, a tool to learn mathematics in an embodied and intuitive way. While reading about it, I couldn't help wanting to try it for myself. I kept wondering what would be the best way to do Turtle geometry today. This article is about my first foray into it, using <lnum>p5.js</lnum>.
    <!--     <sc>In the Summer of 2017</sc>, I read two books that changed my way of thinking about learning and education. <i>Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas</i> and <i>The Children's Machine: Rethinking School in the Age of the Computer</i>, both written by Seymour Papert, make the argument that we need to think deeply about how computers can and will change how we learn. The first book, written in 1980, is a fiery and passionate invitation to experiment with computers, to build new computational tools that change how we learn and unite seemingly opposite endeavours like art and mathematics. The second book, written seventeen years later, is a more mature and reflective look on <i>what happened</i> with a bit of sadness in it but still quite a bit of passion, curiosity and openness. -->

<h3>What is Turtle geometry?</h3>
<p class="noindent">
    <sc>There are</sc> a <i>lot</i> of things to say about the fascinating theory and immense potentiel of Turtle geometry, but for now I will just describe it as simply as possible for the purposes of this embryonic project.
    <!--     I want to make Turtle geometry with <span class="lnum">p5</span>.js. What would be the best way to do it? One important thing for me is to be able to <i>see the turtle move</i>. Seeing a whole drawing appear in a flash is a very different experience from seeing how it is made. I don't want to just see the result of the turtle walk, I want to see the walk itself. -->
</p>
<p>
    In 1967, Seymour Papert created <span class="Silentype">LOGO</span>, a computer system and software toolkit to build educational experiences. One of the key part of <span class="Silentype">LOGO</span> is the Turtle, a mathematical object that only has two properties: a position in space and a heading (a direction in which its &ldquo;head&rdquo; is pointing). To make the Turtle move, you give it instructions in a language called <span class="Silentype">TURTLE TALK</span>. For example, the command <span class="Silentype">FORWARD 50</span> makes the turtle go forward 50 steps. The command <span class="Silentype">LEFT 180</span> makes it rotate left by 180 degrees. The code below makes the Turtle draw a square:
</p>
<pre><span class="Silentype">FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
</span></pre>
<p class="noindent">
    To make a series of instructions (a program) easier to read and write, <span class="Silentype">LOGO</span> also has a <span class="Silentype">REPEAT</span> command. It repeats every commands before the word <span class="Silentype">END</span>, the number of times indicated to the right of the command <span class="Silentype">REPEAT</span>. This is another way to draw the same square:
</p>
<pre><span class="Silentype">REPEAT 4
    FORWARD 100
    RIGHT 90
END
</span></pre>
<p class="noindent">
    The Turtle has other interesting commands, for example <span class="Silentype">PENDOWN</span> lowers a pen to draw the path of the Turtle, and <span class="Silentype">PENUP</span> lifts &nbsn;it.<snr label="pendown">Yes, this does mean that a Turtle has more properties than just <i8>position</i8> and <i8>heading</i8>. While the mathematical theory behind Turtle geometry requires only <i8>position</i8> and <i8>heading</i8>, you'll see soon that playing with Turtles usually involves giving them more properties.</snr>You can also create custom functions, with this syntax:
</p>
<pre><span class="Silentype">TO SQUARE
    REPEAT 4
        FORWARD 100
        RIGHT 90
    END
END
</span></pre>
<p class="noindent">
    To continue the analogy of talking to a Turtle, creating custom functions was something Papert explained as &ldquo;teaching the Turtle a new word&rdquo;. Your custom functions can also have arguments, using this syntax:
</p>
<pre><span class="Silentype">TO SQUARE WIDTH
    REPEAT 4
        FORWARD WIDTH
        RIGHT 90
    END
END
</span></pre>
<pn>
    You can then call <span class="Silentype">SQUARE 500</span> and get a square with a width of 500. These are the basic building blocks. This is very simplified, but we can now move on to the question of replicating this with <lnum>p5.js</lnum>.
</pn>
<h3>Replicating <span class="Silentype">TURTLE TALK</span> with <lnum>p5.js</lnum></h3>
<pn>
    <sc>On the surface</sc>, it might seem like a trivial problem to replicate <span class="Silentype">TURTLE TALK</span>, but I think it is deceptively intricate. Let's say we create a <ic>Turtle</ic> class, and then we give it methods like <ic>forward()</ic>, <ic>left()</ic>, and <ic>right()</ic>. Assuming that the methods only do what they are supposed to (move and rotate the Turtle), we would write the following code to create a new Turtle and make it draw a square:
</pn>
<code>
function draw() {
    let t = new Turtle();
    t.forward(100);
    t.right(90);
    t.forward(100);
    t.right(90);
    t.forward(100);
    t.right(90);
    t.forward(100);
    t.right(90);
}
</code>
<pn>
    The unfortunate thing here is that we will not get to <i>see the Turtle move</i>. The square will appear fully formed, because all the <ic>Turtle</ic> methods are called on the same frame of animation.
</pn>
<p>
    This is unfortunate because Turtle geometry is meant to be a way to learn mathematics using our senses and our intuitions, creating mental links between abstractions and experiences. A <a href="">film shot at <sc>mit</sc> in 1983</a> shows a group of children doing Turtle geometry with <span class="Silentype">LOGO</span>, and we can see the Turtles moving on the computer screens. <span class="Silentype">LOGO</span> did not only display the <i>results</i> of a series of commands but the <i>process</i> too. The film also shows a mechanical Turtle: a small robot that takes <span class="Silentype">TURTLE TALK</span> commands and moves over a piece of paper to draw the resulting shapes. While users of <span class="Silentype">LOGO</span> would observe the robot as it moved and drew, the JavaScript code I wrote above is more like entering a room where a robot has already finished drawing something. It builds an incomplete sensory bridge between the abstract Turtle commands and their visual, physical results.
</p>
<p>
    So how could we go about replicating <span class="Silentype">TURTLE TALK</span>&rsquo;s friendly syntax and also get an animated Turtle as a result? This would be a simple way to achieve it:
</p>
<code>
function draw() {
    let t = new Turtle();
    let instructions = [
        t.forward(100),
        t.right(90),
        t.forward(100),
        t.right(90),
        t.forward(100),
        t.right(90),
        t.forward(100),
        t.right(90)
    ];
    if (instructions[frameCount - 1]) {
        instructions[frameCount - 1]();
    }
}
</code>
<pn>
    The problem here is that we cannot use the <span class="Silentype">REPEAT</span> syntax or easily create our own functions like <span class="Silentype">SQUARE</span>. It's possible to do it, but it's very inconvenient.
</pn>
<h3>A way to make it work</h3>
<pn>
    <sc>With all of that</sc> in mind, I created a simple (but somewhat strange) system that addresses most issues. I certainly do not claim that it is <i>the</i> way to replicate <span class="Silentype">TURTLE TALK</span> in <lnum>p5.js</lnum>. I'm just experimenting and testing out ideas. This is how I create a Turtle that draws a square:
</pn>
<code>
let t = new Turtle({
    instructions: function() {
        forward(100);
        right(90);
        forward(100);
        right(90);
        forward(100);
        right(90);
        forward(100);
        right(90);
    }
}); 
</code>
<pn>
    Two things are <i>strange</i> here. Firstly, the <ic>forward(100)</ic> and <ic>right(90)</ic> calls are not methods of the <ic>Turtle</ic> class, they are public functions. Secondly, this is not visible here but those public functions do not actually do what they &ldquo;claim&rdquo; to be doing. They are instead pushing objects in a global array called <ic>instructionBox</ic>:
</pn>
<code>
function forward(size) {
    instructionBox.push({
        f: "forward",
        s: size
    });
}

function right(angle) {
    instructionBox.push({
        f: "right",
        a: angle
    });
}
</code>
<pn>
    These objects are instructions to be executed later. Once a series of them are inside the <ic>instructionBox</ic> array, the system is able to execute them, one per animation frame, letting us see the Turtle's process.
</pn>
<p>
    In the <ic>Turtle</ic> class below, you can see that when an instance of <ic>Turtle</ic> is created, it calls the <ic>instructions()</ic> function that was sent to it, and then collects the results contained in the global <ic>instructionBox</ic> array, saving it in a private property called <ic>states</ic>:
</p>
<code>
var Turtle = function(t) {
    this.heading = t.heading || 0;
    this.position = t.position || new p5.Vector(0, 0);
    this.penDown = true;
    this.awake = (t.awake != null) ? t.awake : true;
    if (this.awake) {
        // We call the instructions() function, filling instructionBox.
        t.instructions();
        // We collect the resulting instructions in this.states.
        this.states = instructionBox;
        // And we empty instructionBox to make room for new turtles.
        instructionBox = [];
        turtles.push(this);
    }
};
</code>
<pn>
    The <ic>constructor()</ic> also lets you see all the properties defining an instance of <ic>Turtle</ic>:
</pn>
<ul class="dash">
    <li>
        <ic>position</ic> and <ic>heading</ic> are most basic. You can see that <ic>position</ic> has a default value of <ic>(0, 0)</ic> and <ic>heading</ic> has a default value of <ic>0</ic>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <ic>penDown</ic> is a boolean letting us know if the Turtle's pen is down or up. It defaults to <ic>true</ic>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <ic>awake</ic> lets us create many turtles and not display all of them. I found out while doing my first experiments with Turtle geometry that it is very useful to create a lot of Turtles with different sets of instructions, and commenting out Turtles to better see others is a very poorly designed experience. So this <ic>awake</ic> boolean, which defaults to <ic>true</ic>, lets us make some turtles &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;.
    </li>
</ul>
<pn>
    The fact that <ic>forward(100)</ic> and <ic>right(90)</ic> are public functions allows us to use them inside <ic>repeat()</ic> functions at will, without ever worrying about the scope. This would not work (I actually need to test it):
</pn>
<code>
var marguerite = new Turtle({
    awake: false,
    heading: 0,
    position: new p5.Vector(10, 0),
    instructions: function(t) {
        var s = 10;
        repeat(3, function() {
            repeat(30, function() {
                t.forward(s);
                t.right(20);
                s += 0.1;
            });
            repeat(60, function() {
                t.forward(s);
                t.left(20);
                s += 0.1;
            });
        });
    }
});
</code>
<pn>
    I always thought that JavaScript should have a simple <ic>repeat</ic> syntax. I first learned programming with HyperCard and thankfully it had one. I think a simple <ic>repeat</ic> syntax is a great learning tool for beginners. It's the friendliest approach possible to loops. Also, how often do we use a <ic>for</ic> loop just to repeat an action a fixed amount of times? The following syntax could be very useful:
</pn>
<code>
// This is not correct JavaScript but maybe it should be:
repeat 4 {
    console.log("This is such a gentle introduction to looping\!");
}
</code>
<!-- // This could also be done in this fantasy world:
var t = 40;
repeat t {
    console.log("My oh my, this is nice\!");
}
// Also, why not that:
repeat Infinity {
    console.log("And Sisyphus watched his rock barrel down the hill.");
} -->
<p class="noindent">
    Is there some underlying reasons why this couldn't be done? Would it introduce any problem that I'm unaware of? Or is it just <i>dumb?</i> Here is the code to my very simple proposal for a <ic>repeat()</ic> function that offers similar functionality:
</p>
<code>
// The repeat() function takes 2 arguments: 
// n is the amount of times it should loop.
// f is the function to call n amount of times.
function repeat(n, f) {
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // We send the index i to the function, for optional use.
        f(i);
    }
}
</code>
<p class="noindent">
    So now, our square can be drawn with this bit of code, which is quite close to its <span class="Silentype">LOGO</span> equivalent:
</p>
<code>
repeat(4, function() {
    forward(100);
    right(90);
});
</code>
<p class="noindent">
    The <ic>repeat()</ic> function can also be nested at will:
</p>
<code>
repeat(4, function() {
    forward(100);
    right(90);
    // Let\'s draw a smaller square at each corner of the big square.
    repeat(4, function() {
        forward(10);
        right(90);
    });
});
</code>
<code>
var marguerite = new Turtle({
    awake: false,
    heading: 0,
    position: new p5.Vector(10, 0),
    instructions: function() {
        var s = 10;
        repeat(3, function() {
            repeat(30, function() {
                forward(s);
                right(20);
                s += 0.1;
            });
            repeat(60, function() {
                forward(s);
                left(20);
                s += 0.1;
            });
        });
    }
});
</code>
<h3>Some concluding thoughts</h3>

    Of course, there might be much better ways to do Turtle geometry with <span class="lnum">p5.js</span>.
