<h3 class="about">&ldquo;How do things take form&nbsp;?&rdquo;</h2>
<p class="noindent">
    <span class="small-caps">I&rsquo;m an artist and animation filmmaker</span> living in Montréal, Québec, Canada. As a visual person, I&rsquo;m fascinated by the relationships between the form of things and their <span class="italic">meaning</span>. This has lead me to use mathematics and algorithms to explore various processes that generate images and movement. Everything around us is engorged and bursting with meaning and those meanings can be explored by interaction and inquiry. I first studied animation film at the Cégep du Vieux Montréal, and then took an illustration course at the International Summer Academy of Fine Arts in Salzburg, Austria. I then studied graphic arts at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Poland, where I concentrated on illustration with professor Zygmunt Januszewski and animation with professor Hieronim Neumann.

<h3>This website</h3>
<p class="noindent">
    <span class="small-caps">To make this website</span>, I developed a Node.js application that reads a database and outputs <span class="small-caps">html</span> content, generating all the files automatically. I created it because I wanted a lightweight static site generator with a few key features (like the possibility of easily managing a database of bilingual content), and I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied by pre-existing generators. You can
    <a href="https://github.com/pelletierauger/pelletierauger.github.io">view the source code</a> for this application on GitHub (along with the source code for this whole website). The main module is <span class="inline-code">maker.js</span>. It reads the data inside the <span class="inline-code">pages</span> and <span class="inline-code">blog</span> folders and uses additionnal modules found in the <span class="inline-code">formatters</span> and <span class="inline-code">node_modules</span> folders. The mathematical formulas displayed on this site are formatted with the <span class="inline-code">mathjax-node</span> module and the syntax of code boxes is coloured with the <span class="inline-code">highlight.js</span> module and with some extra personal touches.
