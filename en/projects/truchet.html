   <p>Dans une entrevue télévisuelle, Rice raconte : &#171; I thought "My, that must be wondeful that 
    someone could discover these things which nobody had seen before, these beautiful patterns. 
    So I started figuring out some way to work on the problem. I studied all of the types 
    that were pictured in the articles, and tried to discover a new type. 
    And I was so delighted when I found it. I couldn't believe it, I didn't really think I would find
    anything. I was just so thrilled. &#187;</p>
