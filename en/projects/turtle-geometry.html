<h3>A mathematician drawing flowers</h3>
<p class="noindent">
    <span class="drop-caps">I</span><span class="small-caps">n the Summer of 2017</span>, I read two books that changed my way of thinking about learning and education. <span class="italic">Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas</span> and <span class="italic">The Children&rsquo;s Machine: Rethinking School in the Age of the Computer</span>, both written by Seymour Papert, make the argument that we need to think deeply about how computers can and will change how we learn. The first book, written in 1980, is a fiery and passionate invitation to experiment with computers, to build new computational tools that change how we learn and unite seemingly opposite endeavours like art and mathematics. The second book, written seventeen years later, is a more mature and reflective look on <span class="italic">what happened</span> with a bit of sadness in it but still quite a bit of passion, curiosity and openness.
</p>
<p>
    I read <span class="italic">Mindstorms</span> as part of a wonderful online book club put together by the p5.diversity initiative and Princeton University&rsquo;s Council on Science and Technology. I was absolutely terrified to take part in this book club because of my social anxiety, but I am very glad I did anyway. My anxiety was such that I was unable to sleep the night before the online meet-ups. I lied awake hoping that people wouldn&rsquo;t think I was stupid or some kind of out-of-touch outsider that had nothing to do with them. Still, I somehow found the courage to participate and found everyone to be very welcoming and kind. It was a beautiful experience, a beautiful way to remind myself that the world can be welcoming and kind sometimes.
</p>
<p>
    Written in 1980, the book makes the argument that computers will drastically change education.
</p>
<p>
    This made me think a lot about how I never liked mathematics growing up. I had good grades but I never felt like I could <span class="italic">do</span> anything with mathematics; it was an abstract language that adults wanted us to learn for no conceivable reason. It was like <span class="italic">English</span>. In the rural French-speaking region where I grew up, English was very much taught as a dead language, one we were never going to use.
    
        <label for="english-teacher" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
        </label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="english-teacher" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote-left">It was only when I got a teacher whose first language was English that I realized how <span class="italic8">beautiful</span> a language it was. He was from Newfoundland and a very inspiring person.</span>
</p>
<p>
    By contrast, when I learned programming in high school with <span class="Silentype">Hypercard</span>,
    
        <label for="hypercard" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
        </label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="hypercard" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote"><span class="Silentype">Hypercard</span> was an utter joy to discover. I recommend it to anyone&nbsp;! Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t because there are even better things now, like p<span class="lnum">5</span>.js&nbsp;!</span> I was extremely enthusiastic from the start. I could <span class="italic">do</span> something with that&nbsp;! Computer programs were things that <span class="italic">did</span> stuff, and writing my own programs naturally seemed like a creative activity. I loved <span class="Silentype">Hypercard</span> so much that I used to write programs on paper when I had no access to a computer and then I typed them in during computer class. I spent hours trying to debug code on paper just by imagining it <span class="italic">run in my head</span>.
</p>
<h3>&ldquo;What should your turtle do next&nbsp;?&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="noindent">
    <span class="drop-caps">B</span><span class="small-caps">eing a mathematician</span>, Seymour Papert spends a considerable portion of his books talking specifically about mathematics education. Seymour Papert created <span class="Silentype">LOGO</span>, which was a rich programming environment and then he created <span class="Silentype">TURTLE TALK</span>, a language to interact with the turtle. For example, the command <span class="Silentype">FORWARD 10</span> would make the turtle go forward for ten steps, and the command <span class="Silentype">LEFT 180</span> would make it turn left 180 degrees. <span class="Silentype">PENDOWN</span> would lower a pen that drew the turtle&rsquo;s path and <span class="Silentype">PENUP</span> would lift it.
</p>
<p>
    Of all the beautiful thoughts that Papert has shared, my favourite is that &ldquo;learning mathematics is like getting to know a person&rdquo;.
        <label for="papert-quote" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
        </label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="papert-quote" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">It&rsquo;s from <span class="italic8">The Children&rsquo;s Machine</span>, which I think is more loving and welcoming even than his first book.</span> I think his whole philosophy is distilled inside this simple thought. It&rsquo;s about technical knowledge becoming warm and humane knowledge, it&rsquo;s about welcoming with an open heart the ultimate frailty of our minds, welcoming our limitations, the limitations of our intellect. Getting to know a person. You can have a rich conversation with someone without knowing anything about where they come from. You can converse richly with them, and then you might learn more about them in good time and all this disorganized knowledge will be linked by the warm and always incomplete idea of <span class="italic">them</span>. Mathematics is a person with whom you can have fun and learn about yourself as you learn about them. You can learn things about them, forget things about them, relearn those things. There are no precise order in which you need to learn about them. So, relax. You&rsquo;re not building an intricate house of cards in your head, you&rsquo;re just getting to know a person. This person is warm, welcoming, and creative beyond belief.
