    <span class="drop-caps">A</span><span class="small-caps">story</span> about the damage that anxiety can bring when it is misunderstood and untreated, the fleeting pleasures found in geometric patterns, and seeking help before falling.

<p class="noindent">
    <span class="drop-caps">I</span><span class="small-caps">cannot sleep anymore</span>. I lie in my bed and feel my body shaking from the inside like an electrical current is passing through me. It has been years since my last good night of sleep. <span class="italic">Years.</span> Years about which my memories are vague, painful, and regretful. Ever so regretful. Over the years I have felt my intellectual faculties fading away, or rather being fractured into tiny unrecognizable pieces. I have felt that I was losing the tools that would allow me to climb from the hole I was falling into. I now live on Rue Everett in Montr√©al, and am awake through a winter night that lasts for months.
</p>
<h3>An array of splendour</h3>
<p class="noindent">
    <span class="drop-caps">I</span><span class="small-caps">spend the bulk of my time</span> browsing mindlessly on the internet. I never have any memory of what I saw or read the day before. Inattention engulfs me. In a way I am still frantically trying to get out of my hole and accomplish something; I just have no tools to navigate anywhere.
</p>
<h3>Mental models of the outside world</h3>
<p class="noindent">
    <span class="drop-caps">A</span><span class="small-caps">bove everything else</span>, I am terrified of losing my mental faculties. My intellectual strenght that I was so proud of. I have come to believe that the mental model that we have of the world <span class="italic">is</span> our intellect. They&rsquo;re the same thing. The sum of all the conversations you&rsquo;ve had, the different frames of references you&rsquo;ve had the priviledge of encountering in your life. This is your mind. Your mind is the product of the community around you.
